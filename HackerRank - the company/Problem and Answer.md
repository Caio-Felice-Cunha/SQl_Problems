Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.<br>

The following tables contain company data:

* Company: The company_code is the code of the company and founder is the founder of the company.<br>

SELECT 
    Company.company_code, 
    Company.founder, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT Lead_Manager.lead_manager_code) AS LeadManagers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Senior_Manager.senior_manager_code) AS SeniorManagers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Manager.manager_code) AS Managers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Employee.employee_code) AS Employees
    
    
FROM 
    Company 
        LEFT JOIN 
    Lead_Manager USING(company_code) 
        LEFT JOIN 
    Senior_Manager USING(company_code) 
        LEFT JOIN
