<br>
This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!<br>

Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.<br>

### Definition and note:
* Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions;
* To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

### events Table:

# My Solution:
````sql
SELECT 
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    COUNT(CASE
          WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1
            ELSE NULL END) / 
    COUNT(CASE
          WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1
            ELSE NULL END),2) AS ctr
FROM 
  events
WHERE
  timestamp BETWEEN '01/01/2022' AND '12/31/2022'
GROUP BY
  app_id;
